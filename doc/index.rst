Purchase Discount Module
####################

Tryton module to add discounts on purchase lines.

From the "Discount" and the "Gross unit price", the "Unit price" field is
calculated as:

Unit price = Gross unit price * (1 - Discount)

By default the number of decimal places of "Gross unit price" and "Discount" is
4. The number of decimal places of "Unit Price" is the sum of both, 8 by
default.
To change the number of decimal places of "Gross unit price" and / or
"Discount", for example 3 and 2 respectively, you can define the following
variables in trytond configuration file:

unit_price_digits = 3
discount_digits = 2
